# Python-Challenge
In this challenge, we were given instructions to write two python scripts that accomplished a set of tasks for the two data sets that we were procided. To accomplish this challenge, we had to use the information that we learned in module 3 to execute creation of lists, directories, tuples, functions, loops, conditionals, print functions, file outputs, and more. Below are the instructions provided per data set.
# PyBank
For this data set, we were asked to generate the following:
1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
6. Final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
# PyPoll
For this data set, we were asked to generate the following:
1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote
6. Final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
